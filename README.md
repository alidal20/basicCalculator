## Introduction
This is a small project I undertook to familiarize myself with the functionality of Visual Studio IDE and C#. This is a simple calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations. Although the GUI provides buttons for all necessary operations, the program receives input via keyboard(Numpad) as well.

## Supported Types
Signed
- Integers
- Decimals

## Main Operations
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Extra Operations and Features
- C: Clears everything
- CE: Clears recent input
- Backspace: Remove the last digit of current input
- Repeat Operations: Click Equals button or press the Enter key after performing some operations to repeat the last operation
- Chained Operations: Allows multiple operations (Does not check precedence - i.e. operations are always sequential)
- Diplay Chained Operations: Display operation input that user provides before clicking Equals or pressing the Enter key
